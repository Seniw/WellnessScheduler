        ### FAQ
        **What if the file isn't converting properly when using the XLS to XLSX converter?**
        * Double-check that the file is properly downloaded and is an XLS file. If the issue persists, try uploading it again or use a different converter tool.
        * Try using one of the following resources:
            * [XLS to XLSX Converter - FreeConvert.com](https://www.freeconvert.com/xls-to-xlsx/)
            * [XLS (EXCEL) to XLSX (EXCEL) (Online & Free) - Convertio](https://convertio.co/xls-xlsx/)

        **What happens if I forget to deselect 'Waitlist' or 'Late cancel - no charge'?**
        * Leaving these options selected will cause inaccurate data to appear in the reports, such as "waitlist" or "late cancel" appearing on the weekly availability.

        **Error: "Please upload both files to generate the report."**
        * **What it means:** It appears if you click the "Generate" button before uploading both the Trainer Availability file and the ScheduleAtAGlance file.
        * **How to fix it:** Simply drag and drop both required Excel files into their upload boxes. Once both files are showing, click the "Generate Availability Report" button again.

        **Error: "The date ranges in the filenames do not match. Please upload files for the same week."**
        * **What it means:** The program checks that both files cover the same time period to prevent mistakes. This error means the dates in the two filenames are different.
        * **How to fix it:** Check the filenames of the spreadsheets you downloaded. Make sure you have the correct Trainer Availability and ScheduleAtAGlance reports for the same week. Re-upload the correct matching files. Do not change the filenames. Go to the reports screen in mindbody and re-download the report for the correct date range.

        **Error: "An error occurred... One or both files could not be processed. Please check the file formats and ensure they are not empty."**
        * **What it means:** This is a general-purpose error that can happen for a few reasons. It usually means the program couldn't read the inside of one of the files correctly, even if it uploaded fine.
        * **How to fix it:** This error can almost always be solved with one of these steps:
            * **Check if the Files are Empty:** Open both Excel files on your computer to make sure they contain the usual schedule and availability data. If one is blank, you will need to re-download it from the source.
            * **Check for Correct Files:** This is the most common cause. Double-check that you haven't accidentally uploaded the wrong file. For instance, uploading the "ScheduleAtAGlance" report into both upload slots will cause this error.
            * **Look for Strange Formatting:** Open the "Trainer Availability" file. Does it look normal? If there are any unusual changes, like deleted columns or all the text merged into one cell, the program might not be able to read it. Try re-downloading a fresh copy of the file.
